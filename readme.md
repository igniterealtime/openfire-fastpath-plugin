# Fastpath Plugin Readme

## Overview

The Fastpath plugin adds support for managed queued chat requests, such as
a support team might use.  For example, a web based "Live Support" interface
can point a potential customer at a workgroup representing the Sales team.
Members of that workgroup will receive notification that a someone is
waiting and when someone from that workgroup accepts, the customer and the
team member will be connected to communicate with each other.


## Installation

Copy fastpath.jar into the plugins directory of your Openfire installation. The
plugin will then be automatically deployed. To upgrade to a new version, copy
the new fastpath.jar file over the existing file.

## Configuration

Configuration is performed under the <b>Fastpath</b> tab in the Openfire
admin console.  The legacy quick start guides can be found
