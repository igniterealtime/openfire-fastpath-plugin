# Fastpath Plugin Readme

## Overview

The Fastpath plugin adds support for managed queued chat requests, such as
a support team might use.  For example, a web based "Live Support" interface
can point a potential customer at a workgroup representing the Sales team.
Members of that workgroup will receive notification that a someone is
waiting and when someone from that workgroup accepts, the customer and the
team member will be connected to communicate with each other.


## Installation

Copy fastpath.jar into the plugins directory of your Openfire installation. The
plugin will then be automatically deployed. To upgrade to a new version, copy
the new fastpath.jar file over the existing file.

## Configuration

Configuration is performed under the <b>Fastpath</b> tab in the Openfire
admin console.  The legacy quick start guides can be found
[here](https://discourse.igniterealtime.org/t/fastpath-quick-start-guides-legacy)

## Quick Setup

### Step 1
Create a group in Openfire for each website agent list. Add to each group, all users that will act as agents/experts that will handle chat requests from visitors. For example, add user another_agent to demo_agents shared group.

### Step 2
Create another group in Openfire for each website workgroup. This time add only the XMPP address of the workgroup chatbot as the single user. For example, add chatbot demo@workgroup.your_server.chat to demo_workgroup shared group.

### Step 3
In Openfire, create a workgroup for each website preferably using the same name as the website. For example, the XMPP address of demo will be demo@workgroup.your_server.chat.
